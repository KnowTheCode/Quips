# Quips Plugin

This plugin let's have some fun! It adds some witty, silly, and thought provoking quips into the content, just to shake up the seriousness of learning code.

## Features
It hooks into the event `content_adder` event, which is driven by the `[content_adder mid=1]` shortcode.  Just put this shortcode into the content wherever you want it.  And bam, it will deliver one *random* quip. Yup, it's random. And yup, it inserts right into the content. Awesome goodness.

## Installation

1. Install the [Fulcrum](https://github.com/KnowTheCode/fulcrum), the central custom repository plugin for WordPress.
2. Then you can install this plugin.

Installation from GitHub is as simple as cloning the repo onto your local machine.  To clone the repo, do the following:
